**Algorithm**

**EXPLANATION**

* The list of HTML files present in the directory and the sub-directories has been extracted. BookKeeping file is given as input to the map reduce job

* Hadoop map-reduce has been used for creating the inverted index and posting list for each term.

* In the mappers section, a unique ID is generated for each file. The document is parsed and tokenized using Jsoup. Stop words has been removed and the tokens are stemmed.

* Each HTML page has been parsed using Jsoup which is a Java HTML parser library.

* Jsoup can extract the content present in each section such as head, title, body.

* Information present in the body section has been extracted by using doc.body().text(), where doc contains the information of whole HTML document.

* Information of the body section is tokenized and the posting list is created for each term.

* The posting list includes Term, Term Frequency, path and Position of each term in the document.

* Each term and the posting list pair is sent to the reducer section.

* The reducer section collects the information of all the mappers and saves the data in the MongoDB. 

* TF-IDF per document per query is calculated.

* The stemmed tokens are searched in the inverted index table.

* For terms in the query, TF-IDF is calculated.

* The cosine similarity is calculated for all the terms present in the query. 

* Tag weights are calculated based on cosine similarity results.

* Page Ranks is calculated for all the terms.

* The top 10 results are extracted and displayed in the UI.

**Hadoop MapReduce**

* MapReduce is a processing technique where data can be processed on large clusters in parallel.

* Distributed Computing can be achieved using Map-Reduce.

* There are mainly two tasks involved namely Map and Reduce.

* Large sets of data are taken by the Map job line by line and converted into key-value pairs. 

* The processes information is sent to the mapper.

* Reduce job processes the data given by the map task. Several tasks of the mapper are combined by the reducer and the data is processed to produce the new output.

**MongoDB**

* MongoDB is a document oriented database which provides easy scalability and high performance.

* It works on the principle of document and collection.

* It can be used in high-end applications such as Big Data, Mobile Applications, Networks, Data Management and many more.

* There is no concept of relationship as in any relational database.

* In MongoDB, each collection has different set of documents.

* Dynamic queries are supported by MongoDB.

* Data is stored in JSON file format.

The following parameters are considered as weighing factors for the retrieval of results:

1. **TF-IDF:**

* TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency.

* If a term appears more number of times in a document, TF-IDF increases. Conversely, it decreases with the increase in the corpus.

* Term frequency (tf) is the number of times the term appears in the document.

* Inverted document frequency (idf) is the number of documents which contains a term.

* TF-IDF is the product of term frequency and inverted document frequency.

    * TF-IDF(score)=log(1+tf)*log(N/df) 

where tf= term frequency and 

 df = document frequency

2. **Cosine Similarity**

* It shows how the two documents are similar to each other.

    * Cosine Similarity = (A*B)/(|A|*|B|)

where, A is the tf-idf weight of the term in the query 

   B is the tf-idf weight of the term in the document.

3. **Page Rank**

* The number of quality links pointing to a page is determined to determine the importance of the link. 

    * Page Rank = *PR(A) = (1-d) + d âˆ‘ (PR(Ti)/C(Ti))*

where, A is the page

	         d is the damping factor

	         T1 to Tn are the pages that link to A

	          PR(Ti) is the page rank of Ti

	          C(Ti)  is the number of outgoing links from Ti 

4. **Tag Weight**

* Weights have been assigned to the tags for the calculation of score. 

**NDCG Output**

NDCG has been improved by the following ways:

* Initially, score was summation of weighted cosine similarity and weighted TF-IDF also weighted score of the <title> tags were considered.

* First, only the <title> tags were considered. Later, all the tags such as <h1>, <h2>, <h3> and <b> were also considered for scoring to improve NDCG.

* Later to improve NDCG, weighted PageRank and weighted anchor text was considered. This made a significant impact on the scoring and NDCG values improved by a good margin.
